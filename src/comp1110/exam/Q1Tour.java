 * COMP1110 Final Exam, Question 1ii
 *
 * Discover all victims (reachable white pieces), given a the initial board
 * and a black knight placed at a particular start position.  The initial board
 * may contain black and/or white pieces in addition to the black knight.
 *
 * A black knight may tour an 8 x 8 chess board according to the following
 * rules:
 *   1. It may move from its current square to any of the eight nearby squares
 *      reachable by either: moving sideways two and vertically one; or vertically
 *      two and sideways one.  Given the board below, a piece at '*' may move to
 *      any of the positions marked with an 'X'.
 *
 *       . X . X .
 *       X . . . X
 *       . . * . .
 *       X . . . X
 *       . X . X .
 *
 *   2. It may not move to a square off the 8 x 8 board
 *
 *   3. It may not move to a square already occupied by another piece
 *
 * The number of 'victims' of the black knight is equal to all of the
 * white pieces that it could ever have reached on a tour according to the
 * above rules for touring the board.
